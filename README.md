# README_GUIDE

> How to compose readme file ***efficiently*** and ***beautifully***.

> - In this section, put the **motivation, why you build this code, what problem does it solve, what you learn.**

## Principles

> Readme file is for yourself, users and the other developers.
> 
> - Keep it ***simple*** and ***specific***.
> - Add a table if your Readme file is too long.

3. Prerequisite

6. Credit / References
    - If you work on the project as a team, list you collaborators.
